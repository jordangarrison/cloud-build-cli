# Cloud Build CLI

> :warning: Please note that this is not yet functional

Out of a desire to stop opening my browser I hope to build a cli interface to cloud build which can be in the terminal beside my editor.

## Current Goals

- [ ] Viewport for build logs streamed to terminal
- [ ] Selectable UI replicating the Cloud Build history view
- [ ] Automatically detect build for current project with git information (quick open feat)
  - Git Ref
  - Repo Name
  - etc...
